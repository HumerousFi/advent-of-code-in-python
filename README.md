# advent-of-code-in-python

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles solved in python. Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge that starts on December 1st and runs for 25 days. Each day, a new puzzle is released, and you have 24 hours to solve it.

## Usage

This repository is made for educational purposes for all the new programmers out there trying to learn and getting their feet wet in python and advent of code. I recommend using this repo as a guide book and trying to understand the logic behind all the solutions inside it.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this repository, please feel free to open a pull request with whatever you think i did wrong in these solutions as I myself am not that amazing of a programmer and still learning new things everyday. I wont accept any complete sollutions. just any corrections and better ideas.
